### Day 9: May 28, Monday.

**Today's Progress**: Worked with a shiny app.

**Thoughts** Found the unique code of the speeches written in the 60's, which you can use to speak publicly about 40-50 minutes. It is necessary to connect the phrases of each of the four variables in turn. I moved this code to shiny app where you can select the number of minutes of speech with the slider and the text will be generated automatically. It was fun.)

### Day 8: May 27, Sunday.

**Today's Progress**: Wrote analog waffle function.
