# Week 2

### Day 8: May 27, Sunday.

**Today's Progress**: Wrote analog waffle function.

**Thoughts** The second week of the challenge began. Wrote analog functions waffle. The display options still need manual adjustment. You can see in the pictures that came out of this on the example of the numerical composition of the US Congress and the Russian Parliament.
